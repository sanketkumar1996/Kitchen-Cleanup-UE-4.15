# Kitchen-Cleanup

It is a Virtual Reality project, completed as a part of Unreal VR Nanodegree program. It starts with taking you in VR home environment. When you start the game, pressing 
# F 
button, the timer also starts, and plates are spawned around you - 5 at a time, at a reachable distance ! Their frequency of spawning are set to 10 sec. 
You need to grab all the plates ( using the grip button ) and put them in sink before 30 seconds. If not able to do so, you lose the game and it takes you to another level. From there, you can start the game again !
If in between, you want to start again - you can press #F again to reset the level !

# Note 
There is a hidden button in the game - pressing which will destroy all the plates in the scene !

# Movement 
You can also move around the scene by sliding your fingers on you left motion controller thumbpad !

Plates do not have gravity enabled, so it makes it tougher for people to grab them !
